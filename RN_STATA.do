// Unlike R, STATA is not object oriented, the primary unit of STATA analysis
//  is the variable within a dataset. Only one dataset can be loaded into 
// STATA at a time, however, it is possible to temporally store constants 
// and vectors in memory without assigning them to a variable.

/*
#### CODE MANAGEMENT
*/

/* Opening a new Do file: click the piece of paper icon to the right of the bargraph 
   icon and under "Graphics". Avoid typing code directly into the "Command" area
   because it can't be saved from there. 

   Writing comments: type "//" before your comment if it's on one line. 
   Enclose comments that spread over multiple lines within /* and */. 
   
   When code runs over more than one line, must use /// at end of line to be continued.
   
   Running commands: highlight line of code, then hold down "ctrl" + "d" for    
   Windows, "shift" + "command" + "d" for Macs. 
   
   Note that Stata lets you abbreviate many functions. */

#### OPENING DATA
*/

// You'll need to set your "working directory"
// Note that slashes should be reversed for Mac users
cd "C:\Users\TLandsman\Documents\Georgetown_Fall_2021\MathCamp"

// You'll need to clear memory whenever you want to use a new dataset

// You can import data by going to "File" -> "Import" -> select data 
// Importing Stata data:
use Stataexample.dta

// Importing csv files:
import delimited "csvexample.csv"

// Importing Excel data:
import excel "Excelexample.xlsx" firstrow // "first row" means row 1 is variable names

// Importing certain sheet from Excel file:
import excel "Excelexample.xlsx", sheet("SheetName") firstrow

// women in 2010 state legislatures)
